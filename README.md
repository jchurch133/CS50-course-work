# CS50-course-work

#This repository showcases my earliest work from October 2022, when I first decided to pursue Cloud Engineering. Albeit this repo 
features random course work problems for specific goals, it doesn't provide a major solutions to greater goals, like my other 
projects will. I mainly added this repo as a testament to my foundational learning in CompSci.

#CS50 is the Harvard, Intro to Computer Engineering course, 13 weeks long, available online. I completed more than half of the practice
sets before I decided I had enough of a foundation in the field to begin my AWS Cloud Engineering studies. Even though I didn't 
continue the practice sets, I still finished all of the lectures and took notes over the concepts.

#In the course, I mainly practiced in C++ and python. I learned the fundamentals which have significantly helped me when I come across
basic terms like strings, arrays, variables, pointers, queries, bits in relation to number limitations, memory efficiency, loops, 
return values, and recurion. 

#Without this knowledge I wouldn't be able to piece code repositories together, manipulate code from youtube videos, and fix things 
when they break. My biggest goals now are figuring out quicker, more efficient ways to do things, and ensure I am meeting industry
standards for security and collaboration.
