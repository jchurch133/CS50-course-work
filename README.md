# CS50-course-work

#This repository showcases my earliest work from October 2022, when I first decided to pursue Cloud Engineering. I mainly added 
this repo as a testament to my foundational learning in Computer Science.

#CS50 is the Harvard, Intro to Computer Engineering course, 13 weeks long, available online. I mainly practiced in C++ and python, 
learning the fundamentals for basic terms like strings, arrays, variables, pointers, queries, bits in relation to number 
limitations, memory efficiency, loops, return values, and recursion. 

#This knowledge enabled me to piece code repositories together, manipulate code from youtube videos, and fix things when they break.
My biggest goals now are figuring out quicker, more efficient ways to do things, and ensure I am meeting industry standards for 
security and collaboration.
