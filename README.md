# CS50-course-work

#This repository is simply a place where I showcase my earliest work from October 2022, when I first decided I would embark on this journey into cloud engineering.
With minimal coding experience from working in the computation layer of a math teaching program called "Desmos", I knew I needed to start with a solid foundation. 

#I came across this free, Harvard, 13 week course, intro to computer engineering, called "CS50". I completed more than half of the practice sets before I decided it was taking too long,
because I wanted to dive into more real world applications not just short, non-applicable proofs of concept. 

#Nonetheless, I finished all of the videos and took notes which gave me the fundamental knowledge of computer systems and how they work that I was seeking. 
I mainly practiced in C++ and some python. Understanding the fundamentals has significantly helped me when I come across basic terms like strings, arrays, variables, pointers, queries, bits
in relation to number limitations, memory efficiency, loops, return values, and recurion. 

#Without this knowledge I wouldn't be able to piece code repositories together, 
manipulate code from youtube videos, and fix things when they break. I know how things work so my biggest challenge now is figuring out quicker, more efficient ways to do things, 
and ensure I am meeting industry standards for security and collaboration. 

#With that said, there's nothing worth looking at in this repo since it is a culmination of random course work problems, but this process took months and I added this repo as a testament
and proof of my arduous initial journey into coding.
